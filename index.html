        <p class="body-text sub-font">By observing the chart of educational profile of the City of Detroit community between 2010 and 2015, it can be concluded that the rates of less than high school graduate and high school graduate decreased by
          5.31 and 1.44 percentage, respectively. Meanwhile, the rates of some college degree and bachelor’s degree or higher increased by 5.95 and 0.80 percentage, respectively. That shows the number of students with higher education had risen,
          which affects socio-economic profiles in many aspects. The college education increases the chances that adults will move up the socio-economic ladder. Higher education improves the poverty rate. The 5% poverty rate in 2011 for bachelor’s degree
          recipients was about one-third of the 14% poverty rate for high school graduates. College education leads to healthier lifestyles, reducing health care costs. In 2007–2010, when 35% of all men and 36% of all women ages 25 and over were de
          need as obese, 28% of men and 26% of women with Bachelor’s degrees were obese.

        <p class="body-text sub-font">Compared to the U.S. aggregate level, the crime rate in Detroit is much higher. However, we can see decreases in violent crime and property crime between 2005 and 2015 in Detroit. At the same time, the rates of
          violent crime and property crime also declined. From that trend we can see, Detroit is an epicenter of public safety of the U.S.. Therefore, solving the safety issues in Detroit is the primary task for the American government.

          Detroit has been losing population (see the figure below) and is known as one of the major “shrinking cities.” Although recent demographic data shows that Detroit is gradually stopping losing population, many people argue that it would still be very unlikely to see a dramatic population gain for the city in the near future.

        <p class="body-text sub-font">Detroit underwent rapid growth in the 1920s, while automobile industry skyrocketed. It became a city which relied on cars. By 1950s, major changes in the automobile industry were underway. The mass migration of industry to low-paid areas caused bankruptcies of car companies and massive population loss in Detroit. Between 1947 and 1963, the city lost over 140,000 manufacturing jobs. However, the situation of Detroit city has improved and a deceleration of population has slowed in recent 7 years. As for the GDP for Metro Detroit, which consists of the Detroit city and surrounding area, it increased year by year, as the below line graph shown.
